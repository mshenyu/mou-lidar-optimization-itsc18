Folder "c" and folder "matlab" are the source code offered by Gurobi.
You can't directly git clone these two folders and need to install the source code from Gurobi official website because there's a license issue.

Put the "main.m" in folder "src" into folder "matlab" installed and run it to get a ".lp" file which is the model created by Gurobi.

Then run "mip2_c.c" in folder "c" installed to get the positions of lidars in the model you designed in "main.m".

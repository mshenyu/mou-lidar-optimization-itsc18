I recommend that readers first read the paper and then go to the code.

In main.m

This is for generating the Gurobi optimization model.

At the beginning the parameters for lidar system are defined.
Noting:
Since the cylinders are defined to select and divide cubes in the ROI, the radius of the largest cylinder must be less than the length of the ROI to have cubes to select. So the parameters must satisfy: cyl_Num*cyl_r < max(cubeNumx, cubeNumy, cubeNumz)

If readers want to customize the lidar system, the supposed parameters to define are:

Nl: number of liras
Nr: number of lasers on each lidar
cubeNumnx: number of cubes in half axis of x
cubeNumny: number of cubes in half axis of y
cubeNumnz: number of cubes in half axis of z
theta: The angles of all lasers on one lidar
model.lb/model.ub : the boundary of x,y,z

In mip2_c.c

This is official Gurobi example code.

Nothing has to be changed here. Just run the code to read the model generated by main.m.
